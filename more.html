      <div class="project-container">
        <p class="project-description">“Credit Where It’s Due” was a three-month-long project, created by a friend and me. For this project, we researched the impact and contributions of black models and designers to the fashion industry today. To represent our research, we then crocheted 23 pieces in total. Each piece was either a direct recreation or inspired by a movement the model/designers started or contributed significantly to. Our culminating presentation was a fashion show, where we had 15 models in our show. I'm the first one on the right in the blue dress.</p>

It offers functionality similar to Pinterest, but more personalized. After taking a quiz that determines their style aesthetic, users are given numerous outfit ideas they can use to style their own clothes and step up their outfits. <b>Look good, feel good, do good!</b></p>

        <p class="project-description">For my final project in the Data Science curriculum at Kode with Klossy, I worked with a group to create a data visualization for a phenomenon known as the “school-to-prison pipeline”. We used Google Colab and SQL to understand the purpose of finding good data, how to clean it, and how to organize it. Then, we organized our data in Google Sheets and used Looker Studio to create eye-catching visualizations.</p>
